//          the last real character in str as str[len(str)-1]
//      b.  start_idx is 0, thus str[0] is the first character in the
//          string.
//
//  2.  Loop while end_idx > start_idx

//word_print() - algorithm
//
// Start by copying the code from count words.  Recall that that code counts
// individual words by incrementing wc when it encounters the first character 
// in a word.
// Now, at this point where we are incrementing wc we need to do a few more things
//      1. incrment wc, and set word_start to true like before
//      2. Now, set wlen to zero, as we will be counting characters in each word
//      3. Since we are starting a new word we can printf("%d. ", wc);
//
// If word_start is true, we are in an active word, so each time through the loop
// we would want to:
//      1. Check if the current character is not a SPACE_CHARACTER
//         a.  IF it is NOT A SPACE -> print the current character, increment wlen
//
//      2.  In the loop there are 2 conditions that indicate a current word is ending:
//          a. word_start is false and the current character is a SPACE_CHARACTER
//                  OR
//          b. the current loop index is the last character in the string (aka the
//             loop index is last_char_idx) 
//
//          IF either of these conditions are true:
//              - Print the word length for current word - printf(" (%d)\n", wlen);
//              - Set word_start to false
//              - Set wlen to 0 given we are starting a new word
